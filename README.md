## About Me
Hi, I'm Tom, a French student at Ã‰cole 42 with a passion for low-level programming, optimization, embedded systems, and reverse engineering. I enjoy digging into how things work at the bare-metal level.

## My Projects
Some of my more recent work lives on [a personal Git server](https://git.tmoron.fr/tom).  
Here are a few highlights from there:
 - [ft_malloc](https://git.tmoron.fr/tom/ft_malloc) - 42 project where we have to recreate the malloc/realloc/free functions
 - [libasm](https://git.tmoron.fr/tom/libasm) - 42 project to learn asm x86 (intel syntax)
 - [aoc](https://git.tmoron.fr/tom/aoc) - my solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/about) challenges
