# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
Hi, I'm Tom â€” a French student at Ã‰cole 42 with a passion for low-level programming, optimization, embedded systems, and reverse engineering. I enjoy digging into how things work at the bare-metal level.

## My Projects
Some of my more recent work lives on a personal Git server: [git.tmoron.fr/tom](https://git.tmoron.fr/tom).  
Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories.
